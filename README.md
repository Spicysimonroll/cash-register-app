# cash-register-app

The Cash Register App is a Ruby application that simulates a cash register system. It allows users to manage a product inventory, add products to a cart, remove products from the cart, and calculate the total price with discounts applied to specific products.

## Overview

This project in built using OOP principles, emphasizing its flexibility and modularity. The code is structured around classes and objects, which enables easier maintenance, scalability, and extensibility. Each component of the cash register system is encapsulated within classes, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Cash Register App, ensure you have Ruby and RSpec installed on your system.

### Installing Ruby

   ```

2. Windows:

  - Download and install Ruby from [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
  - Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

3. Linux(Ubuntu/Debian):

   Use the package manager to install Ruby:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ruby-full
   ```

### Installing RSpec

RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby. You can install it using RubyGems, the Ruby package manager.

1. Install RSpec:

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install RSpec:

   ```bash
   gem install rspec
   ```

   This will install RSpec and its dependencies on your system.

## Installation and Usage

Now that you have Ruby and RSpec installed, you can set up the Cash Register App and use it.
